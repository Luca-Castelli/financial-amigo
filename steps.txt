Absolutely! The PRD will serve as our living document and single source of truth. As we implement features and discover new requirements or better approaches, we'll keep it updated.

Let's start with Phase 1 of our implementation plan:

1. âœ… Next.js frontend project (already done)
2. Initialize FastAPI backend
3. Configure NextAuth authentication
4. Set up PostgreSQL database
5. Implement basic API structure

Would you like to start with setting up the FastAPI backend? I'll help you:
1. Create the project structure
2. Set up the development environment
3. Configure PostgreSQL
4. Create initial API endpoints

Let me know if you want to proceed with this, and I'll help you get started!
